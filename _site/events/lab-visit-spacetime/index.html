<p>We visited the SpaceTime High Performance Computing Lab IIT Bombay. The visit was both informative and inspiring. <a href="http://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/people/Faculty/prof/rbs.html">Professor Sunoj</a> (Convener, SpaceTime HPC) and Mr. Trirag Chowdhury (SysAd, SpaceTime HPC) explained the various components and processes that must work harmoniously in order for the 22teraflop supercomputer to do it’s job. The main hardware required for the computing part are Master nodes and several Computing nodes. These nodes are designed to be able to function 24x7 with zero downtime. There’s a huge network of cables (total 6 Km in length!) beneath the floor that connects these nodes. Much of the remaining equipment is engaged in enabling the nodes to function properly, from power supply to cooling. For the facility to be function ceaselessly, redundancy and hot-standby are essential features in every aspect including data storage, cooling system, etc. To know more about the lab visit the <a href="http://spacetime.iitb.ac.in/index4.htm">website</a>.</p>

<p>This High Performance Computing facility was ranked 1st in India in 2009 and was among the top 500 in the world for two consecutive rankings. The facility is used by various departments in the institute. This lab is a brainchild of Professor Sunoj who worked dedicatedly towards building this facility overcoming numerous challenges on the way. The message he wanted to share with young minds of the day was that “If you think you can achieve it, no matter how big or risky, stand up for it. Give in your best, and realise that it can happen. It will.”</p>

<p>Over 130 professors across 14 departments in the department use this excellent facility for their HPC needs. Professor Sunoj also briefed us about how he was motivated to build a supercomputer in the campus to suffice his needs in Computational Molecular Chemistry. He is also spearheading the next 52 teraflop HPC installation in the institute ‘SpaceTime-X’ and is a part of the National Supercomputing Mission, with the vision to set up a 1500 teraflop cluster, catapulting India in the supercomputing race!</p>
