We have been taught classical physics in our curriculum till today, and we have developed a point of view to see the world through its laws, which are properly set up in our subconscious mind. But then quantum comes and claims its all wrong! we should see the world through quantum! Shrinivas Prasad Kulkarni through this report shows that there is another point of view to see this world, and that's Thermodynamics, through which the world looks beautiful, yet familiar.

It is used in many branches of mathematics, such as differentiable equations, dynamical systems, knot theory, and Riemann surfaces in complex analysis. It is also used in string theory in physics, and for describing the space-time structure of universe. Millen Kanabar explores the basics of this discipline in this project.

Quantum computation is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. A quantum computer is used to perform such
computation, which can be implemented theoretically or physically. 
For problems above a certain size and complexity, we dont have enough computational power on Earth
to tackle them. To stand a chance at solving some of these problems, we need a new kind of computing. Universal quantum computers leverage the quantum mechanical phenomena
of superposition and entanglement to create states that scale exponentially with number of qubits, or quantum bits.
Kritti Sharma explores quantum
computation and quantum information theory from the perspective of theoretical computer
science and develop a strong grip on linear algebra, discrete probability and theory of computation by getting a fair idea of the quantum circuit model of computation; basic
quantum algorithms like Grover, Simon, etc; quantum entanglement.

Physics is all about motion of things and the forces which cause that motion, be it the motion of planets around a star, motion of electrons and protons in an atom, or the motion of molecules which results in emergent properties like temperature and so on. The role of relativity is to study how that motion looks from different perspectives like moving,  accelerating and so on.

Name: Aditya Harakare
Mentor: Saurabh Kumar
Signal processing is a sub-field of electrical engineering that concerns the analysis, synthesis, and modification of signals. In this project we will go through a journey starting right from mathematical preliminaries required for signal processing to the applications of DSP in real life such as image processing. We will walk through the various algorithms like Karplus Strong and learn about the Fourier Transform and its implementation. We will learn about different types of filters and concepts like Sampling and Interpolation.
We will also get acquainted with the things we use in everyday life like MP3 and JPEG and learn the science behind it.

The ability to sway a person's choices by simply changing some fonts may seem far-fetched, but that's exactly what Behavioural Economists have managed. Behavioral Economics shows that changing even seemingly insignificant aspects of context can be instrumental in increasing organ donations, encouraging students to pursue further education, or even just selling more popcorn. Ashita Yedida explores the basics of this fascinating subject, where human behaviour is studied and expressed in concise mathematical expressions.

Today we live in a world where the privacy is a hot topic and a global concern. Among those concerns is also a concern of privacy of money.
All the money that we own or transact is not hidden from the banks or any third party service that we may be using. Cryptocurrencies are a solution to this problem. These are digital currencies secured by strong cryptography and they are decentralized. They achieve this feature with the blockchain technology. This technology was originally conceived for Bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency.

Reinforcement learning, in the context of artificial intelligence, is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment.  This is not supervised learning, this is not unsupervised learning, it is an entirely different field with it's roots in the basic essence of how our brains function, how humans learn things, that is by interacting with their Environment. Mridul tries to explore this state of the art & promising field of AI.

Reinforcement Learning is an increasingly popular technique for organizations that deal regularly with large complex problem spaces. Because Reinforcement Learning models learn by a continuous process of receiving rewards and punishments on every action taken, it is able to train systems to respond to unforeseen environments. Aditi Kadam explores MDP and value iteration algorithm  that is based on reinforcement learning

No matter which programming language you want to program in, if you want to write an efficient code, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is your way to that. Ritika studies DSA, an effective tool to solve computational problems efficiently. You can find a report of her learnings here.

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.
