### from Molecules to Intelligence!
![](/images/Algorithmic-Biology-Talk/poster.jpg)

A biological cell is nothing but a collection of molecules, yet displays behavior many orders of magnitude more sophisticated than non-biological collections of molecules of the same size, and gives rise to the manifold phenomena of life that we see all around us. This is because the molecular ensembles in cells are self-organized into structures and networks that together execute sophisticated algorithms. This ballet of molecular interactions allows living systems to respond in exquisite ways to their environments, and makes them appear _intelligent_. Algorithmic Biology is an emerging discipline which attempts to discover, recreate, and explain biological phenomena from an algorithmic perspective.


__About The Speaker:__ Professor Manoj Gopalkrishnan has recently joined as an Associate Professor in Electrical Engineer at IIT Bombay. He was previously a faculty member in the School of Technology and Computer Science at TIFR Mumbai. He received his PhD in Computer Science from University of Southern California and BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kharagpur. He is broadly interested in connections between Information, Biology, and Physics.

The talk began with Prof. Gopalkrishnan describing the extent of sophistication achieved by the biological cell and how even a small step towards understanding the details could lead to great advancements. He talked about biochemical reaction networks and how they can be used to model complex statistical phenomena in the simplest of manners - using a _soup_.  

In an attempt to show how such analogies can be formed, he discussed a portion of his own work and pitched the _chemical soup_ against a statistician, for solving a very common problem - parameter optimisiation using [MLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation). The example used was of a triangular die whose outcomes are dependent on 2 unknown parameters. The magic of _mass-action kinetics_ gives us that the soup converges to Maximum Likelihood Distribution corresponding to the initial conditions known. This is a very non-trivial theorem and professor developed an intuition behind how it works on the basis of the _MaxEnt Principle_. The claim that mass-action kinetics maximises entropy, which eventually converges to the MLD of the outcomes is very interesting, and can be seen as _Machine Learning_ in the soup. In this way, we can also claim that the biological cell is performing _"machine learning"_ at some extent, which is very fascinating.  

He went on to explain in what kinds of estimation problems - particularly the log-linear models - the method can be applied, and developed more rigour in the claims. The trick behind the working is derived from topology, toric geometry, information geometry and the MaxEnt Principle of other things. The concepts that go into demostrating this are pretty wide-spread and open new frontiers of inter-disciplinary research!  

Towards the end of the talk, the professor showed how recent advances in computational biology and DNA computing can be mapped onto his research and although we do not know where all this would lead us, it sure is a step - and a whole new _nano_-world awaits us!
