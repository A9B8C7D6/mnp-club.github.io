Summer of Science is an initiative by the Maths and Physics Club, to encourage, and help discover, the joy of learning.

_“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” - __Mahatma Gandhi___


Has there been something you wanted to explore, but never been able to, for lack of guidance, or simply been unsure where to start? Anything ranging from Computer Architecture, General Relativity, Cosmology, to Abstract Algebra!

Got an idea? Have the enthusiasm? We’ll find you a mentor, with sufficient experience on the topic, to guide you on your quest, for the whole duration of summer – starting the first week of May to the second week of July. It is not required to be present in the institute during the entire period of SoS - the interaction with the mentors will be online, and a report has to be submitted by the second week of July. Learning is best done at your own pace - there is no strict requirement on the minimum content that has to be covered. However, it is very strongly recommended that you focus on SoS for at least 25 days during the summer.

A report has to be submitted by the end of the summer, tentatively by second week of July..The Reports will be put up on the website! The SoS certificate, with equal standing as that of ITSP, will be awarded on submission of the report. On the swag factor, we’ll be having a group discussion by the beginning of the semester to discuss what we have learned over the summer.

*“Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.” **― Benjamin Franklin.***

And lastly, the only prerequisite is enthusiasm. No prior knowledge on the topic is expected, and a broad topic is typically chosen at the start of the summer - the specifics can be figured out along the way!
